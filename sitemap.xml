Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy
is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the
whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't
want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal
oneself to the world.


If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of
their interaction. Each party can speak about their own memory of this;
how could anyone prevent it? One could pass laws against it, but the
freedom of speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to an open
society; we seek not to restrict any speech at all. If many parties
speak together in the same forum, each can speak to all the others and
aggregate together knowledge about individuals and other parties. The
power of electronic communications has enabled such group speech, and
it will not go away merely because we might want it to.


Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a
transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary for
that transaction. Since any information can be spoken of, we must
ensure that we reveal as little as possible. In most cases personal
identity is not salient. When I purchase a magazine at a store and hand
cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. When I ask my
electronic mail provider to send and receive messages, my provider need
not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying or what others are
saying to me; my provider only need know how to get the message there
and how much I owe them in fees. When my identity is revealed by the
underlying mechanism of the transaction, I have no privacy. I cannot
here selectively reveal myself; I must always reveal myself.


Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction
systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An anonymous
transaction system is not a secret transaction system. An anonymous
system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and
only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.


Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography. If I say
something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it. If the
content of my speech is available to the world, I have no privacy. To
encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and to encrypt with weak
cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy.
Furthermore, to reveal one's identity with assurance when the default
is anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.


We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless
organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence. It is to
their advantage to speak of us, and we should expect that they will
speak. To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the realities
of information. Information does not just want to be free, it longs to
be free. Information expands to fill the available storage space.
Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin; Information is fleeter
of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and understands less than Rumor.


We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. We must come
together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions to take
place. People have been defending their own privacy for centuries with
whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes, and
couriers. The technologies of the past did not allow for strong
privacy, but electronic technologies do.


We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are
defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding
systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.


Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to
defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're
going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks
may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all to use,
worldwide. We don't much care if you don't approve of the software we
write. We know that software can't be destroyed and that a widely
dispersed system can't be shut down.


Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is
fundamentally a private act. The act of encryption, in fact, removes
information from the public realm. Even laws against cryptography reach
only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence.
Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with it
the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible.


For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract.
People must come and together deploy these systems for the common good.
Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's fellows in
society. We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your concerns and
hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive ourselves. We will
not, however, be moved out of our course because some may disagree with
our goals.


The Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for
privacy. Let us proceed together apace.


A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.


Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for
individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a
totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct
business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the
True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks
will be untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and
tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly
perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central
importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings
of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of
government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic
interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even
alter the nature of trust and reputation.


The technology for this revolution - and it surely will be both a
social and economic revolution - has existed in theory for the past
decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption,
zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software
protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. The focus
has until now been on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S.,
conferences monitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only
recently have computer networks and personal computers attained
sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next
ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas
economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks,
ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band
transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now
under development will be some of the enabling technologies.


The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this
technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by
drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration.
Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow
national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen
materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make
possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various
criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But
this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.


Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of
medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic
methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of
government interference in economic transactions. Combined with
emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid
market for any and all material which can be put into words and
pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made
possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering
forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West,
so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of
mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed
wire around intellectual property.


Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!
